# Klika Tech Challenge

### TODO List
* Add PostCSS support
* Organize all CSS code
* Tests
* Flow types

### Requirements
* node@7.2.0
* npm@3.10.9
* Debian linux build, but whatever you like.

### Run Application
* "cd" to project root and "npm start". Then open http://localhost:3000 to run application.

### Comments
* Styles are most by default now. Used Tactic-0.6.1 as classesless css framework (just found it for this challege)
* Code you're interested in you can find in Playlist Component (./src/components/Playlist)
* Commits are clean as I used my old startkit with different "interesting" branches I don't want to show :)
* I used npm faker to fill data. It does not match to Playlist columns meanings.
* I started with Flow, but I thought that it's not good idea to use it in test challenge as it slow and not for fun.

### Development
You need to "cd" to project and "npm run webstorm" (to create Webstorm launcher: Webstorm->Tools->Create Commang-line launcher and use name by default).
This command will set NODE_PATH env to allow node look not only to node_modules, but to application source too.


### Finish
It was programming just for fun to show some practices and codestyle in general.
Sure, we can use most of ES6 features in node@7.2 env to tune server, webpack, etc. 
If you need to see more practices just write me.
